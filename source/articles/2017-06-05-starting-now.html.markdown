Ok, so I've been meaning to create this blog for a while now. I have a huge list of programming topics I want to learn. At some point the list became so long that I wasn't sure where to start. I figured creating a blog would help organize the list and make it easier to get started. But then creating the blog became a the bottleneck. After way too much procrastination, I finally got my blog up and running. Since this is the eve of WWDC, the first few posts may be devoted to Swift 4.0. Maybe not.
